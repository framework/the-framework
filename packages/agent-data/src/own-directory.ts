/**
 * A tool's own directory at a project's root, taken away again: the files the tool names as its
 * own go one by one, then the directory once it is empty, then the rule that hid it from git.
 * What a tool's `cleanup` command runs when its files are a few named files in one directory.
 *
 * Nothing else goes. A file git tracks stays, and so does anything the tool did not name: a
 * person may have put it there. A link in the directory's place is followed nowhere, since what it
 * points at may lie outside the project. The rule is the repository's, read by every checkout of
 * it, so it goes only when this pass removed the directory and no other checkout holds one.
