/**
 * The inbox: what reaches a running agent from outside, a file at a path the caller gives, one
 * JSON line per message or answer. Whoever shows the agent (a dashboard) appends lines; the
 * driver reads them when a turn ends and sends each as the next prompt of the same session, in
 * order, until the file is empty. Then the prompt returns and the run ends: no process waits
 * for a line that may never come. A line written later is for a new run that resumes the
 * session by its id.
 *
 * Taking the lines is rename-then-read: the file is moved aside in one step, so a line appended
 * meanwhile lands in a fresh file for the next take and none is lost or read twice.
