/**
 * A question the agent stopped to ask: the one block an agent ends a turn with when it will not
 * decide alone. The block is the contract between an agent and whoever shows the question,
 * a dashboard's card or a runner taking the recommended option unattended; this module is its
 * one parser, so the agent learns one shape and every driver reports it the same way.
 *
 * The block, fenced and tagged `await-choices`, is JSON:
 *
 * ```await-choices
 * { "title": "<the question>", "options": [{ "label": "<option>", "detail": "<one-liner>" }], "recommended": "<label>" }
 * ```
 *
 * `stop: true` on an option marks an answer that ends the session instead of resuming the agent;
 * `multi: true` allows several answers, `default: true` on the entries that start checked;
 * `file` names a markdown file the question is about. The words that teach an agent the block
 * are the caller's: a skill or a system prompt says when to ask; this says what a question is.
