/**
 * A run in flight is a run record (#1774): the `logs` skill's card on the project's `agent-data`
 * branch, written before the agent is spawned with `status: running` and this tool's own mark
 * under `caller`, and written again when the run ends — same id, same file — with how it went.
 * One file for the run's whole life, and every machine that shares the branch reads the same
 * running cards (a scheduler counts them against its caps). No pid is held anywhere: a restart
 * loses nothing.
 *
 * A running card from another machine is that machine's: only its own sweep, or a person, changes
 * it. A machine that never comes back leaves its card running, on purpose: nothing here guesses that a run it cannot see is dead.
