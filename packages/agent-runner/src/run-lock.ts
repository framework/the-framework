/**
 * One process per run at a time (#1774). A run's process holds its run's lock from before it
 * touches the record until it has let the checkout go. A second process for the same run waits
 * until the holder is gone: a resume that comes while the run still records and reclaims, or two
 * resumes started together by two messages. The sweep leaves a run alone while its lock is held.
 *
 * The lock is a file under the tool's directory holding the pid of its holder. A pid that is not
 * alive holds nothing, so a process that died leaves no lock that matters. Per machine, like the
 * pid in it. Two waiters taking over a dead holder's lock in the same instant can both believe
 * they hold it; a holder that dies is already the sweep's case.
