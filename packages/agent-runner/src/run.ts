/**
 * One run (#1774): a checkout from the branches package, a session from agent-driver, the prompt
 * once, and the agent's own loop to the end. No system prompt and no gates: the
 * command's skill file is the whole instruction, and the agent publishes its own work, when asked
 * to, through the skills in its checkout. How far it takes its work is the run's publish level
 * (`run --publish <commit|branch|pr|merge>`), said in one sentence after the prompt: commit the work,
 * and from there push the branch, open its pull request, or set it to merge once its checks pass.
 * The sentence follows every message the agent is sent, a queued one too, and the record keeps it
 * apart from the message. A run with no level gets its prompt as written, and its agent commits
 * only when the prompt asks.
 * This process records the run and reclaims the checkout when the
 * agent stops; a run that dies is caught by the sweep, which a scheduler runs on every tick.
 *
 * The session keeps the run's live record itself, the card and the diary under `.openagent/`
 * in the checkout, in the run record's shape; this process adds its mark, the pid and the host,
 * and copies the two files onto the branch unchanged when the run ends. What reaches the agent
 * from outside comes through the session's inbox: a line waiting when a turn ends becomes the
 * next turn; when the last turn ended on a question and nothing waited, the run ends `waiting`,
 * keeps its checkout, and the answer resumes it (`resumeRun`): the same run, the same record,
 * continued.
 *
 * SIGINT or SIGTERM to this process stops the run: the agent's whole process tree is ended
 * through the driver, the run is recorded `stopped`, the checkout reclaimed. That is what a
 * dashboard's Stop sends, the pid being on the live card; nothing else steers a run.
 *
 * One-shot: `agent-runner run <prompt>` runs on its own. A scheduler's tick spawns the same thing
 * with the marker already written and the id chosen.
 *
 * A run may name a follow-up (`run --then <prompt>`): once it ends done with a pull request, a
 * fresh agent, a run of its own with its own record, works on the same branch from the prompt,
 * the first run's id after it. The first agent is told, in a line after its prompt, to publish its
 * work without arming the pull request's merge, whatever level the run was given; the follow-up
 * is given no level, its prompt says what it publishes; the follow-up ending done is when this
 * process merges it, through the project's git host (`git-host.ts`). A follow-up that fails or is
 * stopped leaves the request open, for a person.
 *
 * The pull request a run's branch has is read back the same way, through the git host the project
 * declares; a project with no git host package records none.
 *
 * A run may be started for another run, its parent (`run --parent <id>`), and from a branch other
 * than origin's default (`run --base <ref>`); both are on its record for its whole life. When it
 * ends, however it ends, its parent is told (`parent.ts`).
 *
 * A run that makes its own branch writes down the commit the branch was made at, on its record
 * for its whole life: the run's own work is what came after it, which is how it is still told
 * apart once it is merged. A run given a branch that exists (a follow-up's) writes none: that
 * branch's work began with another run.
