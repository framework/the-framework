// automations a person made with "New automation", and the commands the project's skills schedule,
// as the project's files say them now.
//
// A row is the same whichever group it is in: its name, what it says it does, one line of where it
// stands (on or off, when it last ran or that its last run failed, and what the scheduler last
// decided for it), one line of its picks (when it runs, how many agents at once, which coding agent
// and model its runs are on, how far its runs publish), and three controls: "Run now" starts one run of it at once (`agent-scheduler now`),
// "Edit" opens its panel in place (`EditPanel.tsx`), and its switch says whether it runs by itself
// (`switch`). One panel or form is open at a time, and nothing opens over one that holds a change
// not saved yet.
//
// "New automation", beside a project's name, opens a form for a prompt of the person's own
// (`AutomationForm.tsx`). The rest is this machine's, read with `agent-scheduler status`: no
// tracked file changes. A command is off until its switch is flipped here.
