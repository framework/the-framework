// and no tracked file changes. Its pace may follow the skill.
//
// A row a person made with "New automation" opens with its own words to change: what the agent is
// told, and its shell line. Its pace is picked in the same place and is the automation's own,
// saved into its file with its words (`agent-scheduler edit`); only a time of day, which is this
// machine's, is kept here (`pace`). It can be removed, after one question (`remove`). When its
// file cannot be opened, changed by hand since it was saved, the panel says why and shows it as a
// skill's row.
//
// Save sends only what changed, one command after the other, each only once the one before it is
// taken; one that is not taken stops there and says why, with everything still as picked.
