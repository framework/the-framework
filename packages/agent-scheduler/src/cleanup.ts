/**
 * `cleanup`: what this tool left in a project, removed, for a person who takes the project out of
 * a dashboard and asks for the tools' files to go too. The tool removes its own and nothing else:
 * a dashboard asks for it by the `cleanup` kind the package declares under `openagent` in its
 * package.json, and holds no list of this tool's files.
 *
 * What goes is the state file and the scheduler's log, then the directory once it is empty, then
 * the rule hiding it from git (`removeOwnDirectory`). The automations a person keeps on this
 * machine stay: they are the person's own writing and exist nowhere else, so the directory and its
 * rule stay with them, and the answer names them among what was kept. Their folder, once empty,
 * goes like the rest. While the state names a scheduler whose process
 * is alive nothing is removed: it would write its state back on the next tick.
