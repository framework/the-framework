  tick                          pull agent-data, sweep, read the commands the project's skills schedule, start what is due, each a run of agent-runner
  init                          this tool's lines in the dashboard's .openagent/hooks.yml, so it runs while the dashboard is open; a line already there is kept
  start [--keep-alive]          the scheduler on, ticking every minute in its own process
  stop [--unless-keep-alive]    the scheduler off; runs in flight go to the end; with the flag a keep-alive scheduler is left running
  status                        the state file, and whether the scheduler's process is alive
  model <id>                    the model every scheduled run starts on (this user)
  offset <points>               how far past the spend boundary a run may still start (this user)
  switch <command> <on|off>     whether a scheduled command runs on this machine, the command as status names it (quoted when it has a word after it); every one starts off, and off is taken for any name
  publish <command> <nothing|commit|branch|pr|merge>
                                how far this machine's runs of a scheduled command publish; commit until picked
  pace <command> <skill|work|N<m|h|d|w|mo>> [HH:MM]
                                how often at most a scheduled command starts on this machine: an interval (15m, 6h, 2d, 2w, 1mo; 1 to 9999), with a time of day
                                for days, weeks or months (2d 10:00, this machine's time); work for whenever its check finds work; skill for the skill's own pace again, taken for any name
  agents <command> <skill|N>    how many runs of a scheduled command may be in flight at once: this machine starts another only while fewer than N are in flight
                                on any machine; a whole number from 1 to ${MAX_AGENTS}; skill for the skill's own number again, taken for any name
  add <name> --prompt <text> [--every <N<m|h|d|w|mo>>] [--when <shell line>] [--waits-for <line>] [--private]
                                a person's own automation, saved as a command skill of the project: the prompt is the skill's text, and its schedule a pace (--every),
                                a check (--when, a shell line that prints what is new; it may read $LAST_RUN), or both; --waits-for says in one plain line what the check
                                waits for. The file is yours to commit: its command starts no run before it is on the commit a run's checkout starts from.
                                With --private it is kept on this machine alone, in this tool's own folder: nothing to commit, nobody else gets the row, and it
                                can start at once: a run is named by the automation's name and handed the prompt. The prompt is in each run's record, which
                                is shared where the project shares its records.
                                Refused for a name a skill of the project, or an automation kept on this machine, already has
  show <name>                   an automation saved with add, as it stands: its prompt, its pace, its check, its file, and whether it is kept on this machine alone.
                                Refused, like edit and remove, for anything whose file does not read as add writes one: a skill of the project,
                                or an automation changed by hand since; those are edited and removed by hand
  edit <name> [--prompt <text>] [--every <N<m|h|d|w|mo>>] [--when <shell line>] [--waits-for <line>]
                                save an automation again under its name: what is given takes the place of what its file said, what is left out stays,
                                and --every, --when or --waits-for given empty (--when=) takes that part out; what a check waits for goes out with the check.
                                Its past runs, its switch and your picks for it stay. A shared one is a change of yours to commit: a run is told the new
                                prompt only once the change is on the commit a run's checkout starts from
  remove <name>                 delete an automation's file, and what this machine held for it: its switch, its pace, its number of agents, its publish pick.
                                Nothing is committed: the deletion of a shared one is yours to commit, and everyone else keeps the command until it reaches them.
                                What was never committed cannot be brought back: all of one kept on this machine, and a shared one's file or its last changes.
                                The records of its past runs stay
  now <command>                 start one run of a scheduled command now, whatever its switch, its pace and the quota left: a person asked for it. A command with a check
                                starts only when the check finds work (it has 10 seconds); how many at once, where a run's checkout starts and whether the
                                coding agent can start hold as on a tick. It needs no scheduler running. Not ready within 20 seconds, it starts nothing
  try --when <shell line>       run a check once, as a tick would, asking what is new since a day ago: what it printed and whether an agent would start; nothing is saved or started;
                                it has 20 seconds, less than a tick gives a check
  cleanup                       remove what this tool left in the project: the state file and the scheduler's log, then .agent-scheduler/ and the rule hiding it from git once it is empty
                                (the automations kept on this machine are your own writing and stay);
                                refused while the state names a scheduler that is alive; the command a dashboard asks for when a project is removed with its files
