/**
 * A scheduled command's pace (#2022): how often at most it starts. A skill gives a starting pace;
 * each person may set another for their own machine, kept in the tool's state. No node imports:
 * the dashboard part reads the same rules.
 *
 * A pace is an interval, a number and a unit: minutes, hours, days, weeks or months. A week is 7
 * days and a month 30. The interval is the least time since the command last started, on any
 * machine. A pace in days, weeks or months may also name a time of day, like a calendar event:
 * the command is then due from that time on, on a day at least that many days after the day it
 * last started. The time is the machine's own local time.
