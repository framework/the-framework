/**
 * The schedule (#2022): the scheduled commands of a project, each brought by the skill it runs.
 * The tool knows no command by name; a skill says it can be scheduled with a `schedule` in the
 * front matter of its `SKILL.md`, and a skill that is not in the project has no command here.
 *
 *     ---
 *     name: update-tickets
 *     disable-model-invocation: true
 *     schedule:
 *       every: 15m
 *       when: npx @openagt/skill-tickets@^1 meta | jq …
 *       waits-for: when an issue changed since the last import
 *     ---
 *
 * A skill with several modes lists one row per mode, each with the `word` the skill gets as its
 * argument (`triage quick`, `triage consensual`):
 *
 *     schedule:
 *       - word: quick
 *         every: 6h
 *       - word: consensual
 *         every: 7d
 *
 * A command is named as a person types it, without the slash: the skill's folder name, then the
 * row's word when it has one. The whole name is the command's identity (its prompt, its switch,
 * its interval, its cap, its run records).
 *
 * `when` is a shell command, run at the repository root. The command is due while the check
 * exits 0 and prints something other than an empty JSON value. The check may read `$LAST_RUN`,
 * the time its command last started on any machine, or was switched on on this one when that is
 * later: a check that asks what is new since then goes quiet once a run was started for it.
 * Inside a single-quoted `jq` program the shell does not fill it in: `env.LAST_RUN` reads it there. `every` is how often at most: the
 * command is due only once that long has passed since its last recorded start. A row carries one
 * or both; with both, the command starts only when both hold. `waits-for` is one plain line
 * saying what the check waits for, for a person: a check is a shell line nothing can turn into a
 * sentence. `agents` is how many runs of the command may be in flight at once, across every
 * machine that shares the repository, from 1 to 99.
 *
 * Whether a command runs, and how far its runs publish, is not the skill's to say: each person
 * sets both on their own machine, in the tool's state. The pace and the number of agents are
 * where the skill starts: each person may set their own there too.
 *
 * A `schedule` the reader cannot read is skipped and named, so a typo stands down one skill's
 * commands and says so rather than silently doing nothing.
 *
 * The schedule is read from every folder a coding agent reads skills from, so a project's skills
 * are all listed; a command whose skill is not in the folder of the agent that runs scheduled
 * commands is listed and never started, and the tick says so.
