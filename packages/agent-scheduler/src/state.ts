 * The tool's state (#1774): one JSON file under `.agent-scheduler/` at the repository root,
 * written by the tool and read by anyone — a dashboard shows it as it is. Per user, never
 * tracked: the directory is hidden through the repository's exclude file, the way `.branches/`
 * is, so no tracked file changes and nothing rides a sweeping `git add -A`.
 *
 * What is here is what would otherwise live in a process's memory: whether the scheduler is on,
 * whether it should outlive whatever started it, the model this user's scheduled runs start on
 * and the spend cushion they take, which scheduled commands this machine switched on, the pace and the number of agents at once a person set for one here, how far this machine's runs of a scheduled command publish where a person picked it, the pid of the scheduler's own process when one runs, and the last tick with what it
 * decided per command. A restart loses nothing.
