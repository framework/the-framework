//
// The rule exists because claude.ai's list statuses are sticky: an in-app visit clears neither
// "Awaiting input" nor "Unread response" (measured 2026-08-25), so visiting every stopped session
// on every cycle would mean 50 visits every half minute for 50 agents. A session is visited when
// its status changed to awaiting, unread or idle since the last read; an awaiting one also when it
// has not been visited for a while — a question asked in prose carries no block, so the list's
// word is the only signal and a re-read is what catches it (#1707); and any session always when
// the dashboard queued an answer for it — that is the one thing the list cannot know.
