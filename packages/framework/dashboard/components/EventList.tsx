// Presentational event log, shared by the live stream and past-run replay. Most events render as
// their human-readable line (the same formatter the terminal uses, so a `driver` turn reads
// "· Read  src/app.ts" rather than raw JSON). Some things get special rows:
//   - The message text: the user's prompt (`driver` `start`) and the agent's reply (`driver` `text`)
//     render their raw text inline, truncated to one line when long and expanding in place on click
//     (#476/#520). The user's own prompt is a grey box on the right, as in a chat.
//   - The agent's steps between two messages (`driver` `action` and `thought`): one folded line
//     for the whole run of them (ToolCalls), opening to one line per step.
//   - Choice gates, when the log knows its project: an open gate is one "Asking" line (the agent's page
//     asks it above the message box); a resolved one collapses to the AnsweredChoice ✓ card and hides
//     its "✓ chose" line.
//   - Screens: the newest open `screen` line at an address, before the run's end, is the live
//     screen itself (InlineScreen); an earlier one stays its one line, and an `ended` one is hidden.
//   - A turn's end and the spend so far are not rows, and neither is a clean end or an end waiting
//     on an answer: the agent's last message, or its question, is how such a turn ends. A stopped
//     or failed end is a row.
//   - The reply a question follows is shown whole: it is what the question asks about.
//   - Subagents, when the log is given the run's: each has a row where it was started, read off
//     its card, so the row of a working one says what it is doing now; and the prompt that told
//     the run a subagent ended is a subagent's row too, not a message of the user's.
// The rows sit in one centered column, as a chat's do, with no label saying each row's kind: the
// user's turn is a box on the right, and every other row says what it is. The first of a run of
// same-kind rows carries the time its diary line was written, shown while the pointer is on the
// row, the same live, reloaded or replayed; a line written with no time shows none. Scrolling
// rides shadcn's Base UI message-scroller (#712): live follows the edge (`autoScroll`) but yields
// the moment the reader scrolls up, replay renders static from the top, and the "Jump to latest"
// chip is the scroller's own inert-when-not-scrollable button.
