// The project home / launcher: the "New agent" page. It is never consumed by an agent: starting
// one appends an agent to the rail and adds that agent's own view (AgentView) alongside, and this
// page stays put, so you can launch again.
//
// It is laid out as an agent's page is. The agents that wait for an answer are rows at the top, in
// the chat's column (#1455 item 4), and the box to start an agent is at the bottom, where an agent's
// message box is. The project's Docs are not here: they are the side panel's "Docs" tab
// (RightRail), on this page as on an agent's.
