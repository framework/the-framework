// The dashboard's address (#784): `/` is the Overview, `/{projectId}` a project's home/launcher,
// `/{projectId}/{sessionId}` one session. `?project={projectId}` on any of them is the one project
// every page shows (#1513). The URL is the selection — what used to be three pieces
// of React state guessing at each other, which is where the #761/#766/#768/#774 bugs came from.
//
// `sessionId` is the agent id (`AgentMeta.id`), not the agent's conversation id with its driver:
// only the agent id is ours, stable, and already the name of its worktree directory. The URL
// carries the id, never the word, so the segment's name here is the last "session" left of #771 —
// the buttons above it say agent (D5).
//
// Both ids are URL-safe by construction (the registry derives a project id from its path, an agent
// id from its start time), so the segments are still encoded/decoded — a URL typed by hand is input.
