// Browser notifications for the two feeds the shell already polls (#627): the "needs you"
// queue and the "new activity" feed. One engine — identity and baseline are both the same code
// the daemon's Discord notifier runs, imported from the framework so the two surfaces cannot
// drift (#935 unified the server side; this is the client side of the same move). What differs
// per feed is wording and where a click goes, which is what a spec is.
//
// Two guards keep it quiet: it never fires unless enabled AND the browser permission is granted,
// and a project's backlog is absorbed as a baseline the first time that project is read whole —
// you only hear about what happens while you are watching, never what was already there.
//
// The baseline used to be a count: the first two observations, whatever they held (#1625). A page
// opened while the daemon could not reach GitHub spent both of them on empty lists, and the first
// fetch that did reach GitHub announced every already-open pull request as new.
