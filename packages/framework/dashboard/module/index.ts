// `framework/module`: what the dashboard offers a module (#1774).
//
// A module is a package that adds to the dashboard; its browser part is the file it exports as
// `./dashboard`. The dashboard finds it in a
// project's dependencies, imports it at runtime, and reads its default export, a
// `ModuleDefinition`. The browser part imports `react` and this file as bare names and bundles
// neither: the dashboard's import map points both at the dashboard's own running copies, so a
// module renders inside the same React tree and uses the same components as the rest of the page.
//
// This file IS `framework/module`: the dashboard's build emits it as its own entry (`/host/module.js`),
// sharing every chunk with the dashboard itself. Nothing here names a skill.
