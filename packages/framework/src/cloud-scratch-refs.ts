// Sweep the scratch refs a cloud hand-off leaves on origin (#1547).
//
// Every "Run on: Claude web" run pushes two refs that nothing ever consumes again: the slash-free
// `cloud-*` ref the driver pushes so the cloud session has a ref it can clone at (#1320,
// anthropics/claude-code#87235), and the run branch (`tf-agent-…`) the worktree sweep
// (#1036) pushes before reclaiming the checkout. The session does its work on its own `claude/*`
// branch and opens its PR from there, so once provisioning settles both refs are dead names on
// origin — one pair per web run, accumulating forever.
//
// The driver cannot safely delete its own ref: session creation only signals "session created",
// not "clone finished", and a ref deleted in that window strands the session (recoverable only
// with `claude --teleport`). So the daemon sweeps instead, and every deletion has to clear four
// gates:
//
// - **Old enough** (~a day) that no provisioning can still be reading it. A run branch carries its
//   start time in its name; a `cloud-*` ref carries nothing, so the sweep remembers when it first
//   saw one and only ages it from there — which also keeps a ref pushed by *another* machine safe,
//   since each machine only deletes what it has itself watched for a day.
// - **Holds no work**: its tip is already reachable from origin's default branch. That is what
//   separates a web run's empty scratch branch from a local run's branch holding unmerged commits —
//   the one thing this sweep must never delete.
// - **No open PR**, so a deletion can never close one.
// - **Not a live agent's**, the same `busy` guard the worktree sweep takes.
//
// Never throws, and conservative on every unprovable case: a ref it cannot prove dead simply
// stays, and the next sweep asks again.
