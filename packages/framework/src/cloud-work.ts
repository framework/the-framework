// Adopt the branch a cloud session actually worked on (#1601).
//
// A web run is a local wrapper that hands the task to claude.ai and ends; the cloud session does
// the work on a branch of its own naming (`claude/*`), never the designated run branch. Nothing
// ever told the run's record about that branch, so every surface keyed to it — the session row,
// the PR resolution, CI watch, merge — stared at an empty `tf-agent-*` branch, and the run read
// as "nothing committed" while its work sat on origin.
//
// The hand-off anchor (#1601) makes the match exact rather than guessed: the driver pushes an
// empty commit unique to the run as the ref the session clones at, so the session's branch — and
// only it — descends from that commit. This pass walks origin's `claude/*` heads, matches each
// waiting run by that ancestry, and records what it finds onto the run's archive as one commit
// on the data branch: the branch, the PR the session opened for it — and when the run was armed
// for a PR the session never opened, it opens the draft PR itself, which is the armed handoff
// finally resolving against the facts.
//
// Conservative on every unprovable case: a run matching no head (the session has not pushed, or
// did nothing) or more than one (ancestry alone cannot say which) is simply retried next pass,
// and a run older than the window stops being asked about at all.
