 * the whole list by reading claude.ai's own session list and visiting only the sessions that need
 * it (#1332), so a long list costs a sidebar read rather than a tab each — which is why the cap
 * of three tabs this used to impose is gone.
 *
 * Recency is still the filter on this side, because a web run's own status says nothing: #1231
 * ends the agent at the hand-off, so every one of them reads `done` whether its session is parked
 * on a question or finished an hour ago. The read-back that tells those apart is the list status
 * the Driver reports, and that lives in the bridge store, not on the record.
