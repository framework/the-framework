/**
 * The plan/backlog document categories the dashboard surfaces in its sidebar
 * (#319, part of the MVP UI #309), so the human can read them beside the agent.
 *
 * These are written per session as `PLAN_<SESSION>.agent.md` (the plan for now) and
 * `TODO_<SESSION>.agent.md` (the backlog), where SESSION is a git-branch slug — by
 * The Framework's own system prompt back when it ran the agent (#323/#326), and by
 * whatever a project's own skills tell an agent to write now. The flat fallback is `PLAN.md`
 * at the root; the `TODO` category has no flat file: the agent queue is not a document of the
 * checkout but a project package's data, and the dashboard shows it on that package's own page
 * and the Overview's AI Queue card (#1774), not here. Scoped and flat-root names are matched
 * against a flat readdir of the root, never taken from user input, so there is no path
 * traversal to guard against.
