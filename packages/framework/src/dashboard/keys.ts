 * The stable identity of a watched item, which the browser notifications dedupe on.
 *
 * A leaf module on purpose: `activity.ts` and `interventions.ts` build their items by reading the
 * store, so they import `node:*` and cannot be reached from the browser bundle. These functions
 * are pure and depend on nothing but the item, so they live here and are re-exported from
 * `client.ts` — which is what lets the dashboard share them instead of keeping a copy that could
 * drift from the item types.
 *
 * The type imports are erased at compile time, so they add no edge to the graph `client.test.ts`
 * walks.

 *
 * The agent is part of the awaiting key because a gate id is only unique within its own agent:
 * every agent's first gate is `await-choices`. Two agents running in one project (#736) and both
 * parked would otherwise share one identity, and the dedupe would announce only one of them.
