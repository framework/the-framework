 * that delivers the answer), so none offers what another would refuse.
 *
 * A `choice` event opens a question; asked again under the same id, the later one replaces it.
 * It closes when the agent goes on (any later event of the agent's own: the answer, or the
 * person's text, began a new turn), and when the run ends for good. An end that says `waiting` closes nothing: the run ended ON the question, its
 * checkout kept, and the answer resumes it. A run that died holding a question ends otherwise,
 * and its question goes with it (#1359): nobody would read the pick.
