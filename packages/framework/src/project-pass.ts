 * The shape every one of the daemon's background passes over the registered projects has (E4):
 * no timer of its own, one turn per `tick()` call from the daemon's single clock, and a `stop()`
 * that takes effect between projects.
 *
 * Five services walk the projects this way — the merged-worktree sweep (#1036), the CI watch
 * (#1418), the branch-links pass (#1580), the cloud scratch-ref sweep (#1547) and cloud work
 * adoption (#1601). They differ only in what they do to one project; the walking, the overlap
 * rule and the stop flag were written out five times before this.

 * the clock's turn happens to be mid-flight. A stopped pass ticks as a no-op, and a `stop()`
 * during a pass takes effect before the next project rather than mid-project.
 *
 * A `projects()` that rejects yields nothing to walk: a registry that cannot be read is this
 * turn's problem, not the daemon's, and the next tick tries again.
