 * records package: a project's finished runs come from whichever of its packages declares that it
 * provides them — `"framework": { "runs": "<command>" }` in the package's own package.json — and
 * the framework reads them by running that command. Swap the package for another that answers
 * the same command line and prints the same shapes, and nothing here changes. No package declares
 * it: the project has no finished runs, only the ones still running in a checkout.
 *
 * The command line a provider answers, each printing one JSON document and exiting 0:
 *   `<command> --local --full --limit N`   the runs, newest first, whole cards
 *   `<command> show <id> --local --full`   one run: the whole card plus `diary`, every line
 *   `<command> delete <id>`                remove a run
 *   `<command> patch <id> [--branch <b>] [--pr <n> --pr-url <url>]`   the two late facts
 * `--local` reads the copy on this machine, no network: the framework polls.
 *
 * The shapes, owned here: {@link RunCard} and {@link AnyDiaryLine}. A running agent's own card in
 * its checkout is the same shape, written by the tool that runs it.
