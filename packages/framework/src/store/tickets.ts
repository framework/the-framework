/**
 * The tickets, as the framework reads them (#1774). The framework keeps no ticket and imports no
 * tickets package: a project's tickets come from whichever of its packages declares that it
 * provides them — `"framework": { "tickets": "<command>" }` in the package's own package.json —
 * and the framework reads them by running that command. Swap the package for another that answers
 * the same command line and prints the same shape, and nothing here changes. No package declares
 * it: the project has no tickets, and the dashboard shows it none.
 *
 * The command line a provider answers, printing one JSON document and exiting 0:
 *   `<command> list --local`   every open ticket, as an array of {@link Ticket}
 * `--local` reads the copy on this machine, no network: the framework polls.
 *
 * That is the whole contract. The framework reads tickets for what it composes across skills: the
 * onboarding step, a queued link's title. Showing them, planning them, claiming and releasing them,
 * and the Overview's hot-tickets card, are the tickets package's own widget, through its own command.
 *
 * The shape, owned here: {@link Ticket}, the row a ticket lists as.
