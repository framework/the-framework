/**
 * Delete a session (#1032): take it out of the dashboard, records and all.
 *
 * This is the sibling of {@link removeProjectWorktree}, and the difference is the whole point.
 * Remove-worktree reclaims the checkout on disk and keeps the session — its row, its replayable
 * log — because the run is recorded on the data branch. Delete removes that record too: the card
 * (`<id>.json`, what the rail lists) and the diary (`<id>.jsonl`, what replays), so the row is
 * gone for good. It is the one destructive-of-history action, which is
 * why the surfaces that call it confirm first. The run is on the data branch, so its deletion is
 * itself a committed, pushed change.
 *
 * What it deliberately leaves is git's, not the dashboard's: the branch `agent-<id>`
 * (or the name the agent gave it) and its commits. Deleting a branch that may carry merged work
 * or an open PR is not a thing a
 * dashboard action should do silently, so the branch stays and delete means "remove from the
 * dashboard", not "erase every trace".
 *
 * Refuses while the agent is still going — Stop is how an agent ends. Any uncommitted work in the
 * worktree is discarded with it, which is the intent here (the session is being thrown away),
 * unlike remove-worktree, which refuses a checkout holding uncommitted work: the branches
 * provider's `remove --discard` (#1774).
