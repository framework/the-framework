 * `npx @openagt/init`: one command gives a project its skills (#2023).
 *
 * In a terminal, with no command, it is a conversation: the skills as a list with ticks, the ticked
 * ones written and the unticked deleted, then "Commit these files now?" and "Open the dashboard?".
 * Run again, the ticks show what the project has now. With a command it asks nothing and prints
 * one JSON document, like the skills' own commands, for scripts: exit code 0 for a result, 1 for a
 * refusal, 2 for a command line that cannot be read.
 *
 * It writes text files and nothing else: no `package.json`, no install, never a push.
