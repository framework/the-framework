/**
 * What a branch holds and where it stands (#1774): the caller's read of a finished agent's
 * work, for the run page's handoff and the "never pushed" queue. Git facts only, read from the
 * project's repository, so the answer is the same whether or not the agent's checkout still
 * exists: the commits the branch has beyond the project's default branch, the files they
 * changed, whether the remote has the tip, whether the default branch already contains it, and
 * the uncommitted paths of the checkout that is on the branch, when one is. The pull request is
 * the caller's own question, asked of the git host, never here.
 *
 * A caller that knows the commit a branch was made at names it (`from`), and the commits and the
 * files are measured so that they are the branch's own ({@link measuredFrom}): from that commit
 * for a branch made from another branch, which holds, beyond the default branch, that branch's
 * work as well as its own, and for a branch the default branch already contains, which holds
 * nothing beyond it and still did its work. A full commit id asked in place of a branch is read as
 * a branch whose tip it is: what a branch held, for a caller that kept its last commit after the
 * branch went.
 *
 * Forgiving throughout: a branch that is gone answers `exists: false` with empty lists, a
 * project without a remote answers `hasRemote: false`, and a git read that fails reads as empty.
