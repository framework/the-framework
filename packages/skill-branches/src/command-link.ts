/**
 * A package's command, linked into a checkout that has none: each command at
 * `node_modules/.bin/<command>`, and the package itself at `node_modules/<package>`.
 *
 * A skill's text tells the agent to run its command by the package's full name,
 * `npx @openagt/skill-branches@0.1`. `npx` looks for a copy of the package in the checkout, and asks
 * npm for one otherwise; a copy it finds, it runs by the command's name from `node_modules/.bin`.
 * In a project that depends on the package the checkout already has both, linked with the
 * project's other tools. In a project with nothing installed (an empty folder a dashboard added)
 * it has neither, so both are linked here: the agent then runs the very copy that made its
 * checkout, with nothing downloaded and no network.
 *
 * The package is linked only beside its own commands. Beside another tool that holds a command's
 * name in the project, the full name would run that tool, so there it is left to npm.
 *
 * Hidden from the project's git through the repository's exclude file, like a skill's link: a link
 * is the package's state, not the agent's work. Best-effort: an entry already there (the project's
 * own copy) is left alone, and a link that cannot be made is a worse run, not a failed one.
