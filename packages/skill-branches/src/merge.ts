 * to merge. Git only, like the push: the merge runs in the project's folder, which must be on the
 * default branch.
 *
 * Nothing is left half done. A merge that conflicts is undone and the files it conflicted in are
 * named; nothing is committed on the agent's behalf, so a checkout with uncommitted work stops
 * the merge before it starts. Once the work is in, the agent's branch goes, since the default
 * branch holds everything it held; a branch whose checkout is still there is kept with it.
