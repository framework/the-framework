description: Bring the project's knowledge files up to date from merged pull requests, or from an agent run's pull request before it merges.

Write what merged work decided and taught into the project's knowledge files. Nobody will answer you: never ask, decide yourself.

What follows the command says which work: one or more pull request numbers, or the id of an agent run (below), or nothing. When nothing follows it, the work is every pull request merged since the start of the last run of this same command that had nothing after it and ended done, as the project's record of agent runs shows, or in the last 24 hours when there is no such run, less every pull request whose body has the line `Post-merge cleanup done.`. If the pull requests cannot be read, show an error to the user saying why and stop. If there is none, say so and stop.

Read each pull request: its changes and its discussion. The knowledge files, each created when missing: `knowledge-base/DECISIONS.md`, the decisions taken and why; `knowledge-base/FACTS.md`, the non-obvious facts; `knowledge-base/INSIGHTS.md`, the insights. Write only what a future agent would need and cannot get from the code itself, and nothing the files already say. If nothing is worth writing, publish nothing. Otherwise commit, push your branch and open its pull request, its body naming the pull requests it covers and ending with the line `Post-merge cleanup done.`; leave the merge to a person. Your last message names each pull request covered and what you wrote.

When the id of an agent run follows the command, you are on that run's branch, and the run's pull request waits to merge until you are done: that pull request is the work. Read the run in the project's record of agent runs, what it was asked and what its agent said, and read the pull request's changes and its discussion. If the run cannot be read, show an error to the user saying why and stop. Open no other pull request and arm no merge: it is merged for you once you are done. If nothing is worth writing, commit nothing; otherwise commit on the branch you are on and push it. Either way, then add the line `Post-merge cleanup done.` at the end of the pull request's body, keeping the rest as it is. Your last message says what you wrote.
