// guard cannot be anyone's memory — the holder may be on another machine, or a cloud session whose
// local process is gone. So the claim is a file beside the ticket, `tickets/<STEM>.lock.md`,
// holding one line, `CLAIMED: <holder>`, on the tickets branch where every reader already looks.
//
// There is no timed release: a holder can legitimately keep a ticket for days, and a lock lifted
// under a live holder re-opens the exact double-work window it exists to close. The lock lifts
// when the ticket is closed with its siblings, when its holder releases it, when a person releases
// it by hand, or when a caller frees a claim it made for a holder it knows ended with nothing.
