 * It used to have two, so the third case borrowed the wrong one: a week line carrying no reset
 * time fell through to "the readout has no week", which is false, and the readout below the alert
 * plainly showed the week it had just denied having.
 *
 * A reset-less week line is a normal shape, not a malformed one — `parseQuotaReadout` returns it
 * whenever Claude Code prints a window without its `· resets …` tail — and it is the shape an
 * untouched account is most likely to print, since there is nothing yet to count down from. So it
 * does not claim a parse failure either; it says what is missing and why that leaves nothing to draw.
 *
 * Deliberately no widening of the parser to make any of these cases go away. Which shape a given
 * account actually prints is not knowable from here, and the message naming what it saw is how
 * that gets reported back — a speculative extra label mapping would just swallow the evidence.
