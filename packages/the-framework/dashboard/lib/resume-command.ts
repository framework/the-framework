// The shell one-liner that picks a session back up in a terminal (#1195).
//
// The dashboard knew the agent's session id and never showed it, so a session you wanted to
// continue outside the dashboard was unreachable: the conversation was on disk and you had no way
// to name it. The id alone is not enough either — the CLI finds a session by the directory it ran
// in, and that directory is usually gone by the time you want it, since an agent that finishes
// cleanly has its worktree removed. So the command recreates the path first; an empty directory
// is enough for the CLI to match the session and read the conversation back.
//
// Deliberately no permission-mode flag: this lands in someone's terminal, and what an agent is
// allowed to do once it reopens is that person's call to make at the prompt, not ours to preset.
//
// With no directory recorded (an older agent, or one that never opened a session) the id is still
// worth handing over on its own, so the caller can say which of the two it copied.
