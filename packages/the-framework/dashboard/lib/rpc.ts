// rather than one network away. What it cost was a build-time transform over every `.telefunc.ts`
// file, a registration table pinning each RPC to the client-baked key of the dashboard source path
// it was re-exported from (rename a file, break every call), a re-export shim per module to keep
// those keys stable, and a dev-server plugin to undo a URL its own client wrote.
