/**
 * The daemon's one background clock (E4).
 *
 * Every sweep used to own a timer: the CI watch on a minute, the worktree sweep and auto PM on ten,
 * the session committer's debounce on thirty seconds, the two Discord watchers on a minute each.
 * Six intervals with six `setInterval`s, six unref calls and six overlap guards, and no single
 * place to look when the answer to "why is nothing happening" is that a sweep is not running.
 *
 * One interval fires, and each job says how often it wants a turn. A job's cadence stops being a
 * duration it has to reason about and becomes a small integer: how many ticks between turns.
 *
 * The base interval is the finest cadence anything needs. Anything slower is that many ticks —
 * exact by construction, because the ratios are integers rather than two timers drifting apart.
