 * Locate the built dashboard bundle (#405): `dist/dashboard-bundle`, where Vite
 * writes it. Returns the directory only when its `index.html` exists, else undefined (the caller
 * then serves the legacy page.ts). Shared by the daemon and the per-run foreground dashboard (#427).
 *
 * One path, because there is one layout. The dashboard used to be its own package, so a published
 * install read a copy of the bundle under this package's dist while the workspace read the original
 * under the other package's — two candidates, a copy step, and a turbo task to sequence them. Now
 * Vite writes here directly and both cases are the same directory (A7).
